1. Introduction
The Calculator Documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that make up a basic calculator application. This documentation outlines the structure, styling, and functionality of the calculator, enabling developers to understand and extend the codebase.

2. HTML Structure
The HTML structure defines the layout and elements of the calculator user interface. It consists of various sections, including the display area and buttons for numbers, operators, and scientific functions.

<!DOCTYPE html>: Document type declaration.
<html>: The root element of the HTML document.
<head>: Contains metadata and external resources.
<body>: The document's main content area.
.calculator: A container for the entire calculator interface.
.display: Displays the current calculation and result.
Buttons for numbers, operators, and scientific functions.
3. CSS Styling
CSS styling is applied to enhance the visual appeal of the calculator and create a responsive design.

.calculator: Styling for the calculator container.
.display: Styling for the display area.
Styling for various button classes (clear, delete, number, operator, scientific, equals, decimal).
4. JavaScript Functionality
This section covers the core JavaScript functionality of the calculator, including basic arithmetic operations, clear and delete functions, scientific calculations, event handling, and error handling.

Basic Arithmetic Operations
updateDisplay(): Updates the calculator display with the current value.
handleNumberClick(event): Handles clicks on number buttons and updates the display accordingly.
handleOperatorClick(event): Handles clicks on operator buttons and prepares for calculation.
calculate(): Performs basic arithmetic calculations based on operator and operand.
Clear and Delete Functionality
clearDisplay(): Resets the calculator to its initial state.
deleteLastDigit(): Removes the last digit from the current value.
Scientific Functions
handleScientificClick(event): Handles clicks on scientific function buttons and performs calculations (e.g., square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, logarithms).
Event Handling
Event listeners are attached to various buttons to capture user interactions.
Error Handling
Error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid calculations (e.g., division by zero, square root of a negative number, logarithm of a non-positive number).
Alerts are displayed to inform users of errors.
5. Conclusion
The provided calculator code offers a foundation for building a functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations and scientific functions. Developers can extend this code to add more features, improve styling, and enhance user experience.
